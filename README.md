 <summary><h2>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me</h2></summary>
     I am an aspiring data scientist from India. I graduated from St. Joseph's University, Bangalore in 2022, where I majored in Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. I have been trained in the field of data science by a company named AlmaBetter, which is one of the leading data science training companies in India. I have also completed a few interesting internships in the data science domain, that have given me a strong foundation of data skills. I have a proven track record of delivering impactful projects and effectively communicating insights. I have a burning desire to be the best data scientist I can be and therefore I am always looking for ways to improve and currently, I am trying to learn and experiment more on topics like deep learning and model deployment. In my free time I like to play football, read non fictional books, and write data science related blogs on Medium. This was just a brief introduction, but feel free to reach out to me if you want to know more about me or my projects!!
