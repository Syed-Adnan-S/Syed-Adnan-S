 <summary><h2>🕵️‍♂️ About Me</h2></summary>
     I’m a Data Analyst with over 2 years of experience turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in driving data-backed decision-making across teams and leadership by combining strong analytical skills with a deep understanding of SQL database management systems.

My technical expertise spans SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, GA4, Microsoft Clarity, and Machine Learning. Whether it's building dashboards, optimizing reporting workflows, or uncovering trends that guide business strategy, I bring a structured, insight-first approach to every project.

I'm also a firm believer in continuous learning and constantly seek out new tools, technologies, and methods that can enhance the quality and efficiency of my work. Known as a collaborative team player and clear communicator, I thrive in environments where data drives real impact.

Outside of work, I’m quite passionate about sports—especially football, MMA, and badminton—which keep me energized, competitive, and focused.

I'm always open to connecting with professionals who are passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems and push boundaries—let’s connect.
